# Operation Proliferation

Operation Proliferation is a research initiative focused on preserving Bitcoin’s decentralization and long-term miner security in a post-subsidy era.

## Core Focus Areas

- Minimum Economic Incentive to Mine (MEIM-3)
- VP Modeling
- Protocol Pooling
- Equilibrium-Based Economics (EBE)
- Post-Halving Security Sustainability

## Problem Statement

As block subsidies decline, Bitcoin must increasingly rely on transaction fees. Current fee market assumptions may not sufficiently support long-term miner decentralization.

This repository explores economic modeling and protocol-level considerations to address:

- Miner revenue stability
- Transaction velocity constraints
- Custodial concentration effects
- Fee market mathematical limitations

## Status

Early-stage research. Open for technical feedback and peer review.
